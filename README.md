# DClean

Literally just a Node version of [DClean](https://github.com/mrxinu/dclean) by [mrxinu](https://github.com/mrxinu) as an excuse to play around with the filesystem

Also, I accidentally wiped my desktop while making this due to a typo (moved everything to /Desktop/{filename} instead of /Desktop/{foldername}/{filename}
